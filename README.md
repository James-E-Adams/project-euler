# Project Euler Solutions

From the author, it's [_ok_](https://projecteuler.chat/viewtopic.php?t=6431) (ish) to share solutions for the first 100 problems, so gonna keep them public here. This repo will never have answers for any problems > 100 unless that restriction opens up.

They're written in JS, and sometimes I optimise them a little bit, so some files will have more than one solution.
